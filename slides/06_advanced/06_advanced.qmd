# Social Science With LLMs

## Efficiency

<br>

#### You don't always need the biggest model

- Start with simple things
- See how well they work
- Use more advanced tools if necessary

## Which tool when? (Annotation)

<br>

- <10k observations: few-shot annotation
- Depending on your budget, this number could be much higher
- \>>100k: train your own model, e.g. with synthetic annotation

### Always validate with human, ideally expert annotations

You can use Paco Tomas-Valiente's [R package](https://github.com/pacotvj99/testsampleR) to determine sample size.

## Validation best practices

- Always validate with human annotations
- Use large samples, quantify uncertainty (e.g. bootstrap)
- Use informed sampling when the data is imbalanced to keep the test set small ([R package](https://github.com/pacotvj99/testsampleR))
- Think about relevant metrics, use multiple
- Compare to benchmarks (random, simpler measures)

## Reproducibility

- Reproducibility is often very hard with LLMs
- Proprietary models go out of fashion - stick to open source
- Try to stick to the same infrastructure
- Explicitly define the relevant parameters to ensure reproducibility (next slide)

#### Do you think reproducibility is important for LLMs?

## Reproducibility Parameters

<br>

- Seeds
- Model version (where possible)
- Temperature (should be 0)
- top-k (should be 1)

## Research Ethics and AI

<br>

- Please read this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k8b2hj/meta_unauthorized_experiment_on_cmv_involving/)
- Get together in groups of 2-3 and discuss
  - Do you think this research was unethical?
  - If so? Why? What were the major issues with the study?
  - Collect 2-3 arguments for your position.

## Climate Impact

- LLMs use up substantial amounts of energy and water and contribute to carbon emissions.
- Training GPT-3 alone is estimated to have produced 552 tons of carbon dioxide. Thats 500+ flights Zurich-New York.
- Data centers might already have 2.5 times the energy consumption of France ([MIT News](https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117)).
- **Use smaller models when possible - this is also economical**.
- [`codecarbon`](https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon) can track the emissions of your own training.

## Security

<br>

- Do not send you sensitive data to OpenAI
- Talk to your university IT about provided infrastructure
- Use your own endpoints
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g. servers in Europe)



## Special use cases

<br>

### Experimental Interventions

As you saw with the reddit study, you can use AI models in behavioral experiments. (Maybe do it better)

### RAG for Archival Research

Researchers working with large amounts of archival data can digitize content and search it with LLMs.

# Break

# Bias

## Bias

<br>

- ML annotations are often inherently biased
- If we use biased measures in our statistical models, our estimates will be biased as well
- This issue is even bigger for LLMs, where the training data is often not known

## Bias: Example

> Do employers favor certain nationalities, holding skills constant?

- You have a dataset of candidate profiles and whether they got an offer for a position or not.
- You measure skill level using a GPT annotation of the candidate profiles.
- You regress hiring decisions on applicants' nationality and skill level.

. . .

#### What might be the issue here?

## Bias: Example

<br>

- Let's assume GPT annotates Croatians as less skilled, other things equal.
- At the same time, employers are discriminating against Croatians.
- Depending on the strength of each bias, Croatians might be estimated to be treated equally or even less discriminated against!

## Summary

<br>

- When we use machine predictions, especially from LLMs, we might introduce unknown bias
- This will bias our estimates and lead to faulty hypothesis testing
- Worst case, this will lead to worse science

. . .

### Thankfully, someone had an idea.

## Design-based supervised learning (DSL)

@egami2024using

<br>

- Corrects statistical estimates based on ML predictions by using annotated gold-standards
- Two major components:
  - 

## DSL - Simplified Intuition


- In a regression, DSL corrects the estimates **where the model deviates from the expert** by replacing these annotations with the expert labels
- Weigh these according to their sampling probability
- Then regress this outcome on our predictors
- Also works when using ML estimates as predictors



::: aside

Note: They also use cross-fitting, but to fully understand the method, I recommend you read their [paper aimed at social scientists](https://naokiegami.com/paper/dsl_ss.pdf).
